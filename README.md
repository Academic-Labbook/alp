# ALP - Academic Labbook Plugin
ALP leverages the powerful WordPress platform to provide an academic
labbook/logbook fit for purpose. It's free, open source, and attempts to be
minimally invasive on the core WordPress functionality, which should allow you
to install additional plugins as you like.

## What does ALP do?
Currently, not much, because it's in alpha development. Here are the features
implemented so far...
 - Multiple author support
 - Change logs for posts and pages
   - Unhides revisions meta box in editor by default
 - Force users to be logged in to view (but maybe later add ability to choose
   between network/individual site access)
 - LaTeX support
 - DOI and arXiv shortcodes
 - Disable certain post meta fields mostly suited to commercial sites, like
   excerpts, trackbacks, tags, etc.
 - Modifies pages to work more like a wiki:
   - Remove authors and dates
   - Display a table of contents in the sidebar (generated from header elements)
 - Special ALP theme
   - Displays multiple authors
   - Displays revision history
   - Shows reference widget under posts/pages showing cross-references to/from other posts/pages

...and here are features planned for the future:
 - Labbook theme
   - Display author, edited posts and recent comments widgets by default
   - Top bar for linking to other network sites?
 - Email alerts for certain things
   - New posts
   - Comments (already built-in, or at least should be)
 - Disable public access
   - Private feed keys (default feeds NOT disabled by forced login; provide
     unique feeds to each user instead; replace feed URL)
   - Stop images being loaded from outside (might require htaccess changes?)
 - LaTeX TinyMCE widget
 - More MathJax configuration options
 - Author list widget
 - Recent edits widget
 - Change names and behaviours of user types:
   - subscriber -> subscriber
   - contributor -> [remove]
   - author -> [remove, or keep for small project students]
   - editor -> researcher
     - can add new categories
   - administrator -> administrator
 - Disable private posts (kinda useless with forced login)
 - Advanced search:
   - Search within PDFs etc.
   - Advanced search page with options to search by revision, etc.
 - Optionally display institute logo (also on login page)
 - Shortcodes for linking to Git/SVN commits and other archives
 - Offline download, e.g. [Simply Static](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/)
 - LSC-specific extensions:
   - DCC shortcodes
     - Add entries to reference widget

## Future ideas
Some feature ideas not considered critical, but nice to have:
 - Outreach pages: share some posts/pages publicly.

## Requirements
In general, you should use the latest version of WordPress as that's the one
that will be supported. With auto-updates to WordPress Core, this is easy.

The plugin has only been tested on PHP7. You must have the [DOM extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php) installed.

Your users should use up-to-date browsers. The theme bundled with ALP (Alpine)
uses CSS Grid, which is only available in recent versions of the most popular
browsers. The [browsers that don't support CSS Grid](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)
represent only around 5% of global usage as of March 2018. This project is not
concerned about losing sales from users running out of date browsers!

## Design principles
 - **Clean code**: there's an awful lot of terribly written code floating around
   in the WordPress ecosystem. This plugin attempts to conform to coding
   standards, and to interfere minimally with the default WordPress behaviour
   where possible.
 - **Modular**: most/all features can be enabled or disabled, and work
   independently from each other.

## Credits
ALP is a mixture of new code and code forked from other open source, GPL
licenced plugins and themes. The code specific to this plugin was authored by
[Sean Leavey](https://attackllama.com/).

The following list of plugins have been partialy adapted into ALP. All have been
modified in some way (e.g. admin settings, class and setting namespaces, features
added or removed, etc.), some more so than others. Here is an incomplete list:

### Co-Authors Plus
Authors: Mohammad Jangda, Daniel Bachhuber, Automattic, Shepherd Interactive, Mark Jaquith  
Link: [Co-Authors Plus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/)

Most of this is adapted for ALP verbatim, but the guest author feature has been removed.

### WP-Post-Meta-Revisions and Revision Notes
Authors: Adam Silverstein, Helen Hou-Sand√≠  
Links: [WP-Post-Meta-Revisions](https://github.com/adamsilverstein/wp-post-meta-revisions) and [Revision Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/revision-notes/)

These plugins inspired parts of the design of ALP's revisions feature, but the code in ALP
is not particularly based on either one.

### MathJax-LaTeX
Authors: Phillip Lord, Simon Cockell, Paul Schreiber  
Link: [MathJax-LaTeX](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mathjax-latex/)

Most of the functional code was adapted for ALP, but the options were reduced to just SVG
rendered MathJax for simplicity.

### Simple Life
Author: Nilambar Sharma  
Link: [Simple Life](https://wordpress.org/themes/simple-life/)

Bootstrap was removed, and replaced with [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).
The overall visual theme has been retained, but many small tweaks have been made, and
support for other plugins like WooCommerce removed.
